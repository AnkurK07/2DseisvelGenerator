# 2DseisvelGenerator
Author : Ankur Kumar <br><br>
This is a generative model that will generate the random  samples of high quality seismic velocity models of earth's subsurface. This is a good application of **Generative AI** in the field of Geoscience.

Go to my [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kankur0007/2DseisvelGenerator) profile and learn how  you can generate high quality random samples of  seismic velocity models with few lines of code. You can aslo see my [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kankur0007/2DseisvelGenerator) in Hugging Face Community. You can see more details about this generative model in **2DseisvelGenerator's model card**. So well , this is a quick introduction of my repositories. Now I am going to tell you that **"What are the fundamental principles working behined this model and why i choose this !** ðŸ¤—. So let's start
